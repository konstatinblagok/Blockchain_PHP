# PHP BlockChain

PHP Blockchain is a simple implementation of the blockchain data structure and proof-of-work using the PHP programming language. It is designed as an introduction to blockchain technology for PHP programmers.

To run, from the command line, run:

php tests/simplechain.php

This will output a simple blockchain with 3 blocks.

php tests/hackchain.php

This will validate the chain before and after a block is changed and shows the immutability of blockchains.
